# Financial Analysis in Retail: A Dive into Pandemic Impact

### Introduction
This project focusses on four major retail corporations of the US: Target, Home Depot, Costco, and Lowe&#39;s. The initial motivation was to extract and analyze financial trends pre, during, and post-pandemic. However, the current progress of the project does not reflect much coherence to that due to certain technical difficulties faced with the extraction of financial metric values from filings, computational resource limitations, and time constraints. Nevertheless, there is ample scope for future work in this direction.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze trends pre, during, and post-pandemic for Target, Home Depot, Costco, and Lowe&#39;s.
- Explore financial metrics and visualize trends for each corporation.
- Identify potential insights and risks faced by these retail giants.

## Methodology

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- <b>Programming Language</b>: Python - my preferred language for its versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries suitable for data analysis and visualization.
- <b>Deployment Platform</b>: Streamlit - chosen for its quick deployment capabilities, despite time constraints.
- <b>Data Extraction</b>: Focused on retrieving financial data from SEC filings, although challenges were faced due to technical limitations.


### Challenges Encountered:
- Insight Extraction: Technical difficulties hindered the extraction of coherent insights, especially regarding pandemic-related trends.
- Computational Resource Limitations: Processing large datasets and complex analyses was challenging due to resource constraints.
- Time Constraints: The time dedicated to the project was constrained, impacting the depth of analysis achievable within the given timeframe.

Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
4. Allow a couple of minutes for the data processing.

### Future Work
Although the current state of the project may not fully reflect the initial objectives, there is significant potential for future work in this direction. With additional resources and time, further analysis could provide valuable insights into the financial performance of these retail giants across different periods, especially in response to significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
